To integrate OpenTelemetry with the OpenAI Agents SDK and capture detailed traces, you'll need to implement a custom tracing processor that intercepts trace data from the SDK and translates it into OpenTelemetry spans. This involves leveraging the TracingProcessor interface provided by the OpenAI Agents SDK and using the OpenTelemetry API to create and manage spans. 
Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. Set up your environment:
Install necessary libraries: openai-agents, opentelemetry-api, opentelemetry-sdk, and any required exporters (e.g., opentelemetry-exporter-otlp). 
Configure OpenTelemetry: Set up a tracer provider, add a span processor (e.g., SimpleSpanProcessor for console output, or BatchSpanProcessor for more efficient exporting), and configure an exporter to send traces to your chosen backend. 
2. Implement a custom tracing processor:
Create a class that implements the TracingProcessor interface from the OpenAI Agents SDK. 
In the processor's methods (e.g., on_span_start, on_span_end), receive trace and span data from the SDK. 
Use the OpenTelemetry API to translate this data into OpenTelemetry spans. This includes creating spans with appropriate names, attributes, timings, and status based on the information provided by the OpenAI Agents SDK. 
For example, you can use trace.get_tracer(__name__).start_span() to create new spans and set attributes with span.set_attribute(). 
3. Integrate the custom processor:
Register your custom tracing processor with the OpenAI Agents SDK using the appropriate method (refer to the SDK documentation). 
Ensure that your application is configured to send traces to your configured OpenTelemetry backend (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, or a cloud-based solution).
